# Lymph Node Patterns

Help researchers develop technology for detecting breast cancer. 

Researchers at the King's College of London are looking for patterns in lymph node statistics.

They need your help. 

They have tons of images of slides containing cells from breast cancer patients. You can help by reviewing the images looking for germinal centers in lymph nodes.

Their research hypothesis is that if a lymph node has many germinal center, then the patient is experiencing an active immune response. 

The reseach is relevantn because breast cancer patients who have lymph nodes containing many germinal centers generally have a better prognosis.

The researchers will use your work to help improve their AI model that helps identify and predict the prognosis for breast cancer patients.
